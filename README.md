# This is the code and discussion for my disease prediction model in R for my data science and statistics course
This is my final project for my Data Science and Statistics course using R.
The content in section focused on creating a logistic regression model to predict the presecne of diabetes within a fabricated dataset.
Part B focuses on creating a causal inference using linear regression between smoking cessation and BMI change over a five year period. Incorporating covariates such as: diabetes, diuretics, age, education and others.
